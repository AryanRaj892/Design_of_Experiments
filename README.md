# Design_of_Experiments

Experiment design is the process of planning and carrying out an experiment to get a reliable,
useful, and cost-effective answer to a question by measuring the results. If an experiment is
well-designed, it will produce valid data, and if the data is analysed correctly, we can draw
reliable statistical conclusions.

This project discusses fundamental principles and various methods of experimental design.
